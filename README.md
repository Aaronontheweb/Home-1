## Rules
- Each project should have at least one maintainer (from the core team or external) and his/her name is mentioned in Readme.md
- Each project should have configured continious integration (Akka.Net TeamCity, AppVeyor, Travis, etc)
- Each project should publish a nuget package (via scripts)
- It would be nice to have nightly build on MyGet
- Could have a different release lifecycle and version numbers from AkkaDotNet
- Each project could use Apache2 or equivalent licence
- Each project should support NetStandard (if it possible)
